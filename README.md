# Tier List Maker

Just another tier list maker. I'm making this for practice, particularly with implementing drag-n-drop with Solidjs

## Steps

These are the steps to get this project going.

1. Draggable items within container (either horizontal or vertical)
2. Move items (mutate array) when dragged item is moved to new position
3. Allow items to be dragged between different containers
